You will need a second person to help you at the beginning of this tutorial to raise the door so that you can replace your torsion springs. These instructions are for replacing two springs on a self-storage rollup door, also known as a mini-warehouse curtain door, that have the typical self-storage style loops on each end of the springs.</p><p>It's late Saturday morning. Your coffee's cold. You're half way finished replacing your garage door torsion springs and you just discovered your end bearing is shot. Or, you've greased every moving part of your door and you still have this loud annoying squeak. And then you find this seized bearing. No problem! This can wait.</p><center><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPa7_Uh9xAQpCSlFWj6KhMqNQpAqaxsjsIDvRH__ur-0FB_7I7PRYjI2-6PD4fu2g?key=VEdmSk5OSUVwa3MxMHJ5LVdUTUN0eXhCSEtCZ1lB&source=ctrlq.org'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q564GMW43j20DOLrcj6SxanF1g3CIuUMzl7Q9MPYum4N5hT4fbUKIj7tPd_IQm60DJcpF6pHrj3JUf-tHoAK0Q2mPjXGwKkPbN7WQ_7DUaexBgb3fH7XHoYt593DLEyDGO3LjjROMg=w2400' /></a></center><h4>Garage Door Spring Repair How Much</h4><p>I remember one DIYer who removed his whole garage door trying to reinstall one of the cables. You can follow a simple procedure to avoid the DIYer's mistake when attempting your own <a href="https://goo.gl/VvX3RR">garage door repair Tucson</a>. In fact, this can be one of the quickest repairs. I can usually do it while holding my breath. It irks the customer because of the service fee. Take a hint from the pros.</p><p>Commercial and industrial overhead doors range from weighing a few hundred pounds to over a thousand pounds. Vertical-lift and high-lift door systems are frequently used in commercial and industrial settings to maximize space. Read below measure your old spring(s) and find your new torsion springs to purchase.</p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aJJ03u0uDGE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><p>Extension springs are long, lighter-weight springs that run perpendicular to the door and are mounted above the horizontal portions of the door tracks. These springs are tensioned by stretching out, using cables and pulleys, as with the torsion system. Because extension springs are merely suspended between two brackets (they are not mounted to a rod, like torsion springs), they must have a safety cable running through each spring. This helps contain the spring in the event of a breakage. Without the safety cable, a spring breaking under tension is a serious safety hazard. If you have old springs that don't have safety cables, you should install safety cables even if you aren't replacing the springs.</p><p>In any case, working with big, heavy springs (not to mention big, heavy doors) is inherently dangerous. Always take precautions to prevent injury if a spring suddenly slips, come loose, or breaks, and always be aware of what is affected by a spring's tension: namely, pulleys, cables, and doors.</p><p>If you want to leave the door open until you can make repairs, block the door track on both sides so the door can't move, and unplug the garage door opener (if you have one). If you want to close the door, you can try closing it with the opener, making sure there's nothing in the door's path, in case something goes wrong. However, this will put some strain on the opener. Alternatively, you can have a few strong helpers hold the door while you disconnect from the opener and carefully close the door manually; again, it will be very heavy.</p><center><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d866475.4207155575!2d-111.64807929502382!3d31.969858687865095!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x86d60adc3539b127%3A0xe205760dfd391c58!2sDiscount+Door+Service!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1529445045521" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen><script type="application/ld+json"> {"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org\/","@type":"HomeAndConstructionBusiness","image":"https:\/\/discountdoorservice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/DiscountGarageDoorCompanyTucson-logo500x500.jpg","name":"Discount Door Service","address":{"description":"Quality garage door repair and replacement in Tucson at a fair price.
